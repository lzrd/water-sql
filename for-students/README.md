# Water Quality Data Analysis

Welcome! You're about to explore real water quality data from the EPA using SQL and Python.

## Quick Start

**New to this project? Start here:**
1. **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - 15-minute guided tour
2. **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)** - Platform-specific setup (Windows/macOS/Linux)

**Ready to go deeper?**
- **[WATER_DATA.md](WATER_DATA.md)** - Complete SQL tutorial and database guide
- **[SPATIAL_ANALYSIS.md](SPATIAL_ANALYSIS.md)** - Geographic analysis and mapping
- **[INTERVIEW_PREP.md](INTERVIEW_PREP.md)** - Practice for technical interviews

**References:**
- **[TIME_CODES.md](TIME_CODES.md)** - Understanding time codes in the database
- **[example_queries.sql](example_queries.sql)** - Sample SQL queries to try

## What You'll Learn

- **SQL**: Query large datasets (3+ million water quality measurements)
- **Python**: Data analysis with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Statistics**: Calculate averages, identify trends, spot outliers
- **Geographic Analysis**: Distance calculations, interactive maps
- **Data Science Skills**: Work with real-world data used by scientists and engineers

## The Database

You have access to EPA STORET water quality data with:
- **3+ million measurements** from thousands of monitoring stations
- **Parameters**: Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, and more
- **Time span**: Decades of historical data
- **Coverage**: Entire state (Washington, Oregon, Illinois, etc.)

## Your Tools

- **SQLite**: A file-based database (no server needed!)
- **Python**: For analysis and visualization
- **Your curiosity**: The best tool of all

## Example Questions You Can Answer

- How has water temperature changed over the last 20 years?
- Which rivers have the best water quality?
- Are there seasonal patterns in dissolved oxygen levels?
- How does elevation affect water temperature?
- Where are the coldest/warmest monitoring stations?

## Need Help?

- Start with **QUICKSTART.md** - it walks you through everything
- Check **WATER_DATA.md** for SQL help
- All example queries include explanations

## Next Steps

1. Open **QUICKSTART.md** or **QUICKSTART.html**
2. Follow the 15-minute tutorial
3. Start exploring the data!
